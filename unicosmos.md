Here is a summary of my MSCA project **UNICOSMOS** - *Unravelling the intertwined correlated states of matter in moire' superlattices*.

**"The interplay of field-tunable strongly correlated states in a multi-orbital moiré system"**:

In this article, we explored the complex behavior of **strongly correlated electronic states** within a **multi-orbital moiré superlattice** consisting of a rotated MoSe<sub>2</sub> monolayer onto a WSe<sub>2</sub> *2H* bilayer. Using advanced experimental techniques and theoretical modeling, we investigated how correlated states emerge upon *hole* doping and how they can be controlled and tuned by applying external electric fields perpendicular to the plane of the trilayer. We found that by manipulating the perpendicular electric field, the system transition between &Gamma-derived and K/K'-derived correlated phases, revealing intricate interplay between orbital, spin and layer degrees of freedom and correlated states. This work has significant implications for the development of next-generation electronic devices, where precise control of strongly correlated systems is essential for applications such as quantum computing and advanced electronics.

**"Short vs long range exchange interactions in twisted bilayer graphene"**:

This study examined the impact of long-range interactions using the self-consistent Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation, compared to short-range atomic Hubbard interactions, on the band structure of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) at charge neutrality across various twist angles. Beginning with atomistic calculations, the quasi-particle band structure of TBG is determined for three types of magnetic orderings: modulated anti-ferromagnetic (MAFM), nematic anti-ferromagnetic (NAFM), and hexagonal anti-ferromagnetic (HAFM). We then extended this analysis by incorporating these magnetic orderings, along with the HF potential, into a continuum model. Away from the magic angle, magnetic ordering has a significant influence on the band structure, surpassing the effect of the HF potential. However, near the magic angle, the HF potential dominates the band structure, with HAFM and MAFM exerting a secondary influence, while NAFM continues to noticeably alter the electronic structure. These findings indicate that the spin-valley degenerate broken symmetry state commonly observed in HF calculations for charge-neutral TBG near the magic angle is likely to favor magnetic ordering, as the Hubbard interactions tend to break this symmetry in favor of spin polarization.
