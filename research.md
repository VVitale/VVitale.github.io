**"The interplay of field-tunable strongly correlated states in a multi-orbital moiré system"**:

---

In this article, we explored the complex behavior of **strongly correlated electronic states** within a **multi-orbital moiré superlattice**. Using advanced experimental techniques and theoretical modeling, they investigate how these correlated states can be controlled and tuned by applying external electric fields. The study focuses on **twisted bilayer materials**, where the introduction of a small twist angle creates moiré patterns that give rise to unique electronic properties, including flat bands that promote strong electron-electron interactions. The researchers demonstrate that by manipulating the electric field, they can transition between different correlated phases, revealing intricate interplay between orbital degrees of freedom and correlated states. This work has significant implications for the development of next-generation electronic devices, where precise control of strongly correlated systems is essential for applications such as quantum computing and advanced electronics.
