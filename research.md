**"The interplay of field-tunable strongly correlated states in a multi-orbital moiré system"**:

In this article, we explored the complex behavior of **strongly correlated electronic states** within a **multi-orbital moiré superlattice** consisting of a rotated MoSe<sub>2</sub> monolayer onto a WSe<sub>2</sub> *2H* bilayer. Using advanced experimental techniques and theoretical modeling, we investigated how correlated states emerge upon *hole* doping and how they can be controlled and tuned by applying external electric fields perpendicular to the plane of the trilayer. We found that by manipulating the perpendicular electric field, the system transition between &Gamma-derived and K/K'-derived correlated phases, revealing intricate interplay between orbital, spin and layer degrees of freedom and correlated states. This work has significant implications for the development of next-generation electronic devices, where precise control of strongly correlated systems is essential for applications such as quantum computing and advanced electronics.
