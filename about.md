Hi there! I am **Valerio Vitale**, currently a **Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow** at the Department of Physics, University of Trieste, working on the [UNICOSMOS](/unicosmos.md) project. My research focuses on theoretical and computational methods in condensed matter physics and materials science, with a special emphasis on **moiré superlattices**. Over the course of my academic journey, I have developed novel techniques in **ab initio molecular dynamics**, contributed to the theory of Wannier functions and its application, and to advancements in the understanding of **strongly correlated states** in moire' materials, such as twisted bilayer graphene and twisted bilayer **transition metal dichalcogenides**.

I am a **member of the developer team** for the **Wannier90 code**[1], which is widely used in the computational materials science community for the calculation of maximally localized Wannier functions. Additionally, I have contributed to other computational codes, such as **ONETEP**[2], which is designed for linear-scaling density functional theory calculations. In previous roles at **Imperial College London** and the **University of Cambridge**, I worked on projects involving **high-throughput materials simulations** and the development of methods for **maximally localized Wannier functions**, which are crucial for studying electronic properties in complex systems. 

My current research aims to unravel the intricate electronic and optical properties of moire' materials with potential applications in energy-efficient technologies and next-generation electronic devices.
