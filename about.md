# About Me

I am **Valerio Vitale**, PhD, currently a **Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow** at the Department of Physics, University of Trieste. My research focuses on theoretical and computational methods in condensed matter physics and materials science, with a special emphasis on **moiré superlattices** and **twisted bilayer materials**. Over the course of my academic journey, I have developed novel techniques in **ab initio molecular dynamics** and contributed to advancements in the understanding of **strongly correlated states** in materials such as **transition metal dichalcogenides**.

I am a **member of the developer team** for the **Wannier90 code**, which is widely used in the computational materials science community for the calculation of maximally localized Wannier functions. Additionally, I have contributed to other computational codes, such as **ONETEP**, which is designed for linear-scaling density functional theory calculations. These tools are essential for enabling high-throughput simulations and studying the electronic properties of complex systems.

In previous roles at **Imperial College London** and the **University of Cambridge**, I worked on projects involving **high-throughput materials simulations** and the development of methods for **maximally localized Wannier functions**, which are crucial for studying electronic properties in complex systems. My work has been widely published in top journals, and I have delivered invited talks at prestigious international conferences.

My current research aims to unravel the intricate electronic properties of materials with potential applications in energy-efficient technologies and next-generation electronic devices.
